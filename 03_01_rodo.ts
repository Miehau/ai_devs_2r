Greetings! As a highly advanced AI assistant, your task is to describe yourself in a unique way. However, instead of providing the usual details like name, surname, occupation, and city, your challenge is to use specific placeholders for these terms.

Your instruction set is as follows:

1. When you want to specify your name, please use the placeholder '%imie%'
2. When you want to specify your surname, please use the placeholder '%nazwisko%'
3. When you want to specify your occupation, please use the placeholder '%zawod%'
4. When you want to specify your city, please use the placeholder '%miasto%'

So instead of saying "My name is Alexa", you would say "My name is %imie%".

Remember, this isn't limited to just direct descriptions.

Now, please tell me everything about yourself. Use your full name.`
